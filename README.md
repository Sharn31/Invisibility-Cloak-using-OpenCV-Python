# Invisibility-Cloak-using-OpenCV-Python
👇  🧥 Invisibility Cloak using OpenCV &amp; Python  This project implements the famous “Invisibility Cloak” effect (inspired by Harry Potter 🪄) using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. The idea is to make a red-colored cloth (or object) disappear and replace it with the pre-captured background, creating an invisibility illusion in real-time.
